* Gamelogic
- [ ] add gamestates
- [ ] add a goal tile
- [X] add a spike tile
- [X] add a checkpoint tile
- [X] boxes can be picked up and moved around
- [ ] boxes can be thrown

* Level
- [X] culling w/ tileIDs
- [ ] levelgeneration
  + [X] support for specifying tile being in foreground/background
  + [ ] support for specifying enemy positions
  + [ ] support for specifying goal
  + [ ] batch neighbouring sprites w/ same texture to one sprite

* Visuals
- [ ] use better tileset
- fix flickering/aliasing (white lines between sprites). Possible solutions:
  + In order to render a sf::Drawable object pixel-perfectly, make sure the
    involved coordinates allow a 1:1 mapping of pixels in the window to texels
    (pixels in the texture). More specifically, this means:
    * The object's position, origin and scale have no fractional part
    * The object's and the view's rotation are a multiple of 90 degrees
    * The view's center and size have no fractional part
  + view.setCenter() only in integer steps (does nothing)
  + use vertex arrays
  + "Keep using floats for all object positions and before drawing anything,
    round it, then add +0.375f to its position"
  + "Another popular solution seemed to be, to instead of using IntRects for the
    texture location, use the FloatRect with GL texture coordinates 0.0 - 1.0
    and substract 0.5 / subrect size from bottom right corner. e.g. if i am
    using a texture atlas containing 8x8 artwork, it was suggested to use 1.0 -
    0.0625 = 0.9375 at the bottom right corner of the texture float rect"
- 3d effect w/ views
- Background parallaxing

* Movement
- [ ] use box2d sensor for jumping
- [ ] fix view following
- [X] Stop jump if hitting box upwards

* Animation
- [ ] build-up/anticipation for jump

* Collision
- [ ] don't collide with nodes in foreground/background
- [ ] improve player collision box
- [ ] collision filtering to improve performance

* Etc
- [ ] compile on windows
- [X] fps indicator
- [ ] screencast: record gameplay footage "ffmpeg -f gdigrab -framerate 30 -i
  title="german.avi - VLC media player" -b:v 3M germ.flv"
